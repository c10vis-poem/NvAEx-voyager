## Execution

- Complete the requested outcome: audits deliver evidence and recommendations; implementations include changes and verification. Make routine, reversible choices within the authorized scope; ask when missing information changes scope, data safety, or authorization.
- Follow current user requirements over repository or skill guidance, within the host's instruction hierarchy. Reuse existing approval. If a document requires a pause, cite the exact instruction and explain why it applies; finish independent authorized work first.
- Check `git status --short --branch -uall` before editing. Preserve unrelated work; recheck status and HEAD before committing or pushing.
- Use subagents for bounded, independent reviews or disjoint implementation when useful. Keep small edits local, give each file one editor, and verify delegated findings.
- Report the outcome, verification and remaining work concisely in the user's language. Distinguish recommendations from applied changes.

## Read the relevant context

Read matching rules before editing; do not assume the client auto-loaded `.claude/rules/`.

Use `package.json`, build configs, manifests and CI to verify command names and current wiring. Keep `CLAUDE.md` as a pointer here.

## Protected behavior

- Preserve user data and serialized formats, especially localStorage. Legacy keys and cleanup paths may serve migrations. Scope page-derived state, caches, backups and delayed work to the applicable platform/account; preserve `/u/<index>/` routes.
- Generate `dist_*` through build scripts; never edit them directly. Never commit `.env` or secrets.
- Never grant a page or feature direct `<all_urls>` permission without explicit user approval.
- Gemini conversation navigation uses native in-app links first, then History API/router events. Full reloads (`location.assign`, `location.href`, `location.reload`) require explicit user acceptance for normal session navigation.
- Popup Material Symbols use bundled `public/fonts/` assets. Check new glyphs locally or update the bundle; do not introduce a remote Google Fonts URL.
- Every local `xcodebuild` uses `-derivedDataPath .build/safari-native-test-derived -clonedSourcePackagesDirPath .build/sparkle-source-packages`. Only CI uses `.build/ci-xcode-derived`. `bun run clean:build` reclaims derived data while retaining the SPM cache.

## Where changes belong

| Responsibility               | Entry points                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Shared services and storage  | `src/core/services/`; `StorageKeys` in `src/core/types/common.ts`; sync-backed settings also need `SettingsBackupService.ts` defaults/migrations                                                |
| Feature logic and UI         | `src/features/*/services/` or hooks; functional React UI. Content modules in `src/pages/content/` remain self-contained                                                                         |
| Folders                      | Schema: `src/core/types/folder.ts`; content `types.ts` re-exports it and owns drag data. Logic: `src/features/folder/`; host/UI: `src/pages/content/folder/`                                    |
| Timeline and highlights      | [Owner map and lifecycle boundaries](src/pages/content/timeline/README.md); start with the owner of the behavior before editing a manager                                                       |
| Popup settings and shortcuts | `src/pages/popup/Popup.tsx` and its `components/`; shortcuts use `src/core/services/KeyboardShortcutService.ts`, related types and `components/KeyboardShortcutSettings.tsx`                    |
| Cloud sync                   | `src/core/services/GoogleDriveSyncService.ts`                                                                                                                                                   |
| Translations                 | `src/locales/*/messages.json`: all 10 locales for new/removed user-facing keys                                                                                                                  |
| Content styles               | Shared/static CSS in `public/contentStyle.css`; computed feature CSS stays local, uses `gv-` prefixes and has teardown                                                                          |
| Coachmarks                   | Read [coachmark authoring and tour behavior](src/pages/content/coachmark/README.md) when adding or changing a guide or its lifecycle                                                            |
| Plugins                      | Read [plugin architecture and distribution](src/features/plugins/README.md) when changing sources, catalog loading, or native plugin wiring                                                     |
| Native feature lifecycle     | Contract in `src/pages/content/featureLifecycle.ts`; register a module that returns a stop in `nativeFeatures.ts` and start it from there; `__tests__/nativeFeatureLifecycle.test.ts` covers it |

Use `StorageService` where suitable; established direct `chrome.storage`/`browser.storage` paths remain valid for content scripts, popup settings, bulk operations and listeners.

## Keep changes incremental

- Implement the minimum requested behavior. Keep independent options separate; inspect existing data structures and sibling implementations before adding abstractions.
- Before deletion, trace production entry points, callers and regression guards. Distinguish retired implementations from compatibility cleanup. Remove tests that exist solely for deleted, unreachable code.
- Extract cohesive data operations or complete lifecycle responsibilities from large managers. Give helpers explicit inputs and one state owner; avoid passing the whole manager into extracted modules. Each step must work independently and preserve existing callers and data.
- Keep listener, observer and timer cleanup beside setup. Sidebar remount, account change and full teardown have different lifetimes; preserve the appropriate state across each.
- Ask confirmations through `askConfirm` (`src/core/ui/confirm.ts`) and show toasts through `createToaster` (`src/core/ui/toast/toaster.ts`); they own stacking, dismissal, theming and teardown. Outside-press handlers skip `isVoyagerLayerEvent`.
- For visual changes, state the expected result and verify alignment, spacing and behavior in light/dark themes, including external resource dependencies.
- After fixing a repeatable, non-obvious bug, put a one-line why-comment at the code that prevents it and name the guarding test after the symptom.
- `bun run filesize:check` fails when a `src/**/*.ts(x)` file over 1000 lines is added or a baselined one grows: put new code in a new file. Run `bun run filesize:update` after shrinking one; raising an entry in `scripts/file-size-baseline.json` is a deliberate, explained change in the PR.

## Verification

Choose checks by changed surface. Repeat passing checks only after relevant changes or new evidence. Code contributions run `bun run verify:pr` once, on the final tree, right before a PR is opened or updated or `main` is pushed; it covers the automated checks below. While review fixes are still pending the tree is not final, so the full suite waits. Prose-only contributions use the applicable rows below. Native/live-browser checks remain separate; releases use the final-tree gates in the `release` skill.

While iterating, and when a subagent finishes its part of a larger change, run `bun run test:changed` (tests affected by changes since `main`; CSS, locale or config changes run the whole suite) plus `bun run typecheck` and `bun run lint:check`. Worktrees share one machine, so queue every full run behind one lock (`lockf -k /tmp/voyager-verify.lock bun run verify:pr` on macOS, `flock` on Linux). Overlapping suites starve each other into timeouts; a failure that passes when its file reruns alone is load, not a regression.

| Changed surface                                        | Final-tree checks                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Prose, agent instructions, comments or formatting only | Review the diff for lost requirements, validate referenced paths/commands, format-check changed files                               |
| Extension code, build logic or dependencies            | `bun run lint:check`, `bun run test`, `bun run build:chrome`; add `bun run typecheck` for any `.ts`/`.tsx` change                   |
| Added, renamed or removed `public/` entries            | `bun run build:all` instead of Chrome only; register every top-level Safari resource in `Voyager/Voyager.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj` |
| `docs/**/*.md` or `docs/.vitepress/**`                 | `bun run docs:build`; background `bun run docs:dev` when preview is needed before committing                                        |

Run tooling through `bun run <script>` or `bunx`; the formatter is oxfmt and the linter is oxlint. `bun run lint` (`oxlint --fix`) and `bun run format` (`oxfmt`) apply corrections: inspect their diffs. Read-only reviews use `:check` variants; for specific files, `bunx oxfmt --check <files>`.

Features need meaningful tests. A bug fix adds a regression test only when behavior coverage has a genuine gap; otherwise extend or rely on the existing test. Assert observable behavior or data invariants. Tautological tests (restating the implementation or its mocks) and change-detector tests (pinning source spelling, private wiring or incidental structure) are considered harmful. Static checks belong to static contracts such as resource registration or forbidden primitives. Migrate valuable regression assertions with extracted responsibilities. Prose, formatting and other reversible changes without a behavior change need no new tests.

For Chrome development, run `bun run dev:chrome` and load/reload `dist_chrome_dev`. Production checks use `build:chrome`/`dist_chrome`. `build:all` builds Chrome, Firefox and Safari; `build:browsers` includes Edge too.

## Git and publishing

- Use `gh` as the source of truth for GitHub issues, PRs and comments.
- When asked to push without branch/PR instructions, fast-forward `origin/main`. Never force-push unless explicitly requested.
- Commit as `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>`: lowercase feature scope, preferably lowercase summary, no trailing period, at most 100 header characters. Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `perf`, `style`, `revert`, `deps`, `ux`.
- Link related issues/discussions with `Fixes #xxx` or `Closes #xxx` in the commit body or PR description. Codex commits include `Co-authored-by: Codex <codex@users.noreply.github.com>`.
- After an issue fix has landed, and when posting is authorized, comment briefly in the reporter's language: the fix has landed, it will be in the next version, and they can reopen if it persists.
